# Pi-Calculation-with-Monte-Carlo-Method
The circle number Pi is approximated with the Monte Carlo method by four times the probability that a point randomly chosen within the square falls into the circle. Due to the law of large numbers, the variance of the result decreases with increasing number of experiments.
